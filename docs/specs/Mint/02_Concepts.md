# **Concepts**

Unlike the default Mint Module of Cosmos-SDK which can vary the inflation rate dynamically based on the ratio of bonded and unbonded tokens at any point in time, the Mint module of the FURY-Network chain follows a strict regime of inflation rates defined as phases

Phases are nothing but specific discreet time frames during which a certain inflation rate holds. Phases have two components:

- duration: The duration is defined as the year_coefficient. It defines the time in years for which a phase will hold. For example a yearcoefficient of 0.75 means that the phase will last for 9 months, that is, 3/4th of a year.

- inflation: This parameter defines the inflation rate of the chain for the phase in question. Inflation is defined as a decimal. That is, inflation of 0.10000 means an inflation rate of 10%.

The duration and inflation rate of phases can be modified via governance.

> If all the specified phases are over, the chain enters a special phase called the final_phase, where the phase duration is infinite and the phase inflation is zero.
> Note that the inflation rate does not depend on the number of bonded and unbonded tokens
